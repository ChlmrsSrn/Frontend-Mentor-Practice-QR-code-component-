### Continued development

Thanks to frontend mentor those free projects that they have I will continue to learn and hone my skills in front end web development, moreover, this project would be my very first clean,
ready to submit project. A simple project but it is my starting point.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Font-Import](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_fonts.asp) - This helped me to import the font because the one doesn't work, well maybe atleaset on my system.
